# Testing Service Worker

Since this plugin will not generate the service worker on `development`, you can test it on local following these steps:

1) add `serve` script to your `package.json` or modify existing with:
```json
"serve": "vite preview"
```
2) build your app and run `serve`:

   with **YARN**:
    ```shell
    yarn build && yarn serve
    ```

   with **NPM**:
    ```shell
    npm run build && npm run serve
    ```

   with **PNPM**:
    ```shell
    pnpm run build && pnpm run serve
    ```

## Testing Service Worker over https

If you want to test your service worker using `https`, follow these steps:

1) add `https-localhost` as `dev dependency`:

    with **YARN**:
    ```shell
    yarn add https-localhost -D
    ```
    
    with **NPM**:
    ```shell
    npm i https-localhost -D
    ```
    
    with **PNPM**:
    ```shell
    pnpm i https-localhost -D
    ```

2) add `https-preview` script to your `package.json`:
```json
"https-preview": "serve dist"
```

3) build your app and run `https-preview`:

    with **YARN**:
    ```shell
    yarn build && yarn https-preview
    ```
    
    with **NPM**:
    ```shell
    npm run build && npm run https-preview`
    ```
    
    with **PNPM**:
    ```shell
    pnpm run build && pnpm run https-preview`
    ```

First time you run the script, `https-localhost`  will ask you about installing `localhost` certificate 
(that will be generated for you), confirm installation on OS (keychain on MACOSX and certificate manager on WINDOWS)
and open `https://localhost` on browser.
